# Introduction #

JES does not yet have a linux installer (feel free to propose one to a committer). There are a few steps that are necessary to get the linux (no java) version running.


# Details #
  * make appropriate file executable (see: man chmod)
  * create an empty file in your home directory named JESConfig.txt
  * Sometimes the default font size for the editor in JES is set to 0. Open the JES settings and increase this to some visible size.
